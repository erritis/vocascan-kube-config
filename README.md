Vocascan configurations for deploying to Kubernetes.

To organize a set of commands into a project, use [Just](https://github.com/casey/just).

---

### Requirements:

To work with this project you need:

- Kubernetes (you can [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/))

- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

- [kompose](https://kompose.io/installation/)

- [Werf](https://werf.io/installation.html)

- Ingress Nginx Controller (or set up ingress in minikube like in [this article](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/addons/ingress-dns/))

---

### Preset storage:

> **Warning**
>
> This is not required for minicube and kubernetes with default storage providers configured. Skip this step if this is your case.

If you do not have configured storage providers, then in the files [local-storage.yaml](local-storage.yaml) and [vocascandb-pv-0.yaml](vocascandb-pv-0.yaml) you will find ready-made configs for the local storage in the cluster, to deploy them, run the command:

> just werf-up-storage

Then you need to create a folder on the server:

> sudo mkdir /mnt/vocascandb

For complete removal:

> just werf-down-storage

The default folder will not be cleared. To remove it, go to the server and run:

> sudo rm -Rf /mnt/vocascandb

Also in the file [vocascandb-pv-0.yaml](vocascandb-pv-0.yaml) you can change the behavior so that when you delete **PersistentVolume**, the contents of the folder on the server are also deleted:

> persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete

---

### Deploy configurations:

Before deploying the project, set up configurations and secrets. In the [.raw](.raw) folder there is an example of configuration files with the **.example** extension, in order to use them copy the file, remove the **.example** extension and make changes if necessary.

To create configurations for Kubernetes, run:

> just werf-convert

The [.kube](.kube) folder should contain deployment configuration files that are not in the git history.

To deploy configurations and secrets, run:

> just werf-up-conf

To completely remove them:

> just werf-down-conf

---

### Application deployment:

To deploy, run:

>just werf-up

To uninstall an application, run:

> just werf-down

To completely remove, including configuration, secrets, and local-storage, run:

> just werf-clear

---

### Encrypt configuration files:

To encrypt the contents of the [.raw](.raw) folder, run:

> just werf-encrypt

To decrypt encrypted files back, run:

> just werf-decrypt

Note that you must have a **.werf_secret_key** encryption key file in your project folder (there are also [two other options](https://werf.io/documentation/v1.1/reference/deploy_process/working_with_secrets.html)).

To generate it run:

> werf helm secret generate-secret-key > .werf_secret_key
